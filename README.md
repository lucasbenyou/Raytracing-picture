# ISE5783_6686_6223
Project in windows systems by Joseph Haiim Amedi and Haiim Hai Benyounes

This project is about the creation of an image using the oriented object programming in Java.
it is the goal of the course "Mini Project of Introduction to Software Engineering"
In order to do it , we used the IDE Intelijet.
We had to design and modeling an image , by utilising elements like the shadows ,
the transparency of an object or even it's reflection in a mirror.
At the end of this project we were asked to do an improvement of our image by doing 
an anti-aliasing.
we did an improvement in terms of system Performance by using 
the adaptive supersampling and  the multi-threading technics.

This image is the result of using a Spot light with a Sphere it was one was one of 
the first picture that we were able to create thanks to the given tests given given by the teacher.

This one is the result of using shadows thanks to a specific light on the triangle .
Its shadow will then appear on our sphere

This picture is one of the last image that that we had to do before creating our own image
we used transparency for the for the blue sphere which is enveloping the the pink one.Both of 
them are then reflected in a mirror

This is what we did at the end of the project , we used eveything that we could in order to show what
we learned during this course.We also did the necesseray improvement that where asked from us .
Such as the anti-aliasing that improve the quality of the picture and also
the adaptive supersampling and the multithreading that are improving the system performance.
